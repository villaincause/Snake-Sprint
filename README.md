# Snake-Sprint
The Snake game is a classic arcade game that has entertained players for decades. This project aims to develop a modern version of the Snake game named Snake Sprint using the Java programming language. The game will be designed to be both engaging and educational, demonstrating core programming concepts such as object-oriented design, event handling, and graphical user interface (GUI) development.

Objectives:
•	Develop a fully functional Snake game using Java.
•	Implement basic game mechanics such as snake movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
•	Create a user-friendly graphical interface.
•	Incorporate sound effects and animations to enhance the gaming experience.
•	Ensure the game is scalable and easily maintainable.

Resources:
•	Development Environment: Java Development Kit (JDK), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
•	Libraries and Frameworks: JavaFx for GUI development.
•	Tools: Version control system (e.g., Git), testing tools (e.g., JUnit).

Expected Outcomes:
•	A fully functional and engaging Snake game implemented in Java.
•	A comprehensive set of documentation, including user manual and technical documentation.
•	Source code that follows best practices and is easily maintainable.
